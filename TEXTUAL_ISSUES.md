# Textual Dashboard Implementation Issues

This branch contains an attempted implementation of a Textual-based dashboard for the Claude Task Runner. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that prevent it from working correctly.

## Known Issues

1. **Integration Problems**: The Textual dashboard implementation does not properly integrate with Claude's streaming output. While the simple dashboard works, the more complex Textual implementation fails to display Claude's output.

2. **Queue Processing**: The async queue processing in `TextualDashboardRunner` doesn't correctly update the UI with streamed content.

3. **Subprocess Streaming**: The modified `claude_streamer.py` uses subprocess.Popen instead of pexpect, which might be causing issues with real-time content streaming.

## Next Steps

For a working dashboard implementation, it's recommended to use either:

1. The `simple_textual_dashboard.py` implementation, which is already working
2. The `fixed_dashboard.py` implementation, which is more stable

To run the simple textual dashboard:

```bash
python -m task_runner.cli.app textual --base-dir ./your_project
```

To run the fixed dashboard:

```bash
python -m task_runner.cli.app run --fixed-dashboard --no-textual-dashboard
```

## Future Work

The Textual dashboard implementation would need significant debugging and refactoring to work correctly with Claude's streaming output. Main areas that need fixing:

1. Properly handling subprocess output in real-time
2. Correctly updating the Textual UI components with streamed content
3. Ensuring the UI refreshes appropriately when new content is available

For now, we're reverting to the simpler implementation to ensure a working product.
